# ðŸš€ Welcome to My Hacking Blog

## About Me

Yo,I'm **77r4sed**, and this is where I'll document my hacking journey.

I've been in the cybersecurity field for about a year now, but I wasnâ€™t fully serious about it until now it first started with some portswigger labs doing recon on some random bug bounty programs reporting vulnerabilities most of them are dupes informational or out of scope lol and some tryhackme and hack the box ctf's . so now finaally i'm focused on leveling up**i hope i dont drop like i always do.**

i thought maybe this blog will help me continue and share my journey

Iâ€™ll be sharing everything I learn, how I learn it, and even the setbacks along the way.

## What Iâ€™m Into

- **Bug Bounty**
  > Hunting for vulns on real targets. Mostly web stuff. Missed a lot. Learned a lot more.

- **Malware Dev**
  >  I'm learning C++ at school, which got me curious about malware dev lol. I like figuring out how attackers operate.
- **programming**
 >i'm finally decided learning python mainly for web automation and scripting cuz i've been ignoring it for a long time 

## Current Focus

Learning **C++**, **Python**, diving into WinAPI, and getting serious with **bug bounty**. Trying to go from a noob to an actual hacker lol.
